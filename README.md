# Profile-web Project

---
## Introduction
This project is not just about the final product; it's a journey of learning and skill development. As a CS student, I embarked on this project to deepen my understanding of modern software development practices and tools.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Emphasis on Learning Process:** The primary focus of this project was on the learning process, exploring new tools, and understanding their practical applications in a real-world project.
- **Understanding of CI/CD:** Gained hands-on experience with Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Jenkins and Docker, learning how to automate and streamline the development process.

## Technology & Features Overview
- **Web Application Development:** Developed a web application as the core of the project. Key functionalities include:
  - **User Account Creation:** Implemented a user registration system allowing new users to create accounts.
  - **User Authentication:** Integrated login and logout capabilities to manage user access securely.
  - **User Profile Management:** Enabled users to update and manage their personal profile.
- **Database Management:** Utilized MongoDB for data storage, ensuring robust and scalable data management.
- **Containerization:** Employed Docker to create isolated environments for both the MongoDB database and the Python web application, enhancing database is security and accessibility by making it accessible only to the server.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Jenkins:** Integrated Jenkins for CI/CD, automating the development pipeline, and ensuring smooth, continuous integration and deployment of the application.
- **Testing:** Implemented unit testing for individual functionality verification and end-to-end testing to ensure seamless integration of different components.
